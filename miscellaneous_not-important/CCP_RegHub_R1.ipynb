       "'The UBS APAC Sustainable Finance Conference 2023 recently took place, bringing together experts from the finance industry to explore how finance can play a crucial role in advancing real sustainability. The conference aimed to encourage discussions on various topics related to sustainable finance and highlight its significance in driving positive change. The event showcased the growing importance of sustainable finance in the Asia-Pacific region and emphasized the need for collaborative efforts among stakeholders to achieve genuine sustainability. The conference provided a platform for industry leaders to exchange ideas, share insights, and identify key strategies to promote sustainable investments in the future. Nowhere else is wealth management flourishing as it is currently in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This upswing hasn\\'t escaped the attention of ... part of UBS\\'s ongoing efforts to explore the potential of blockchain technology in the financial industry. The pilot program involves tokenizing a money market fund, which means representing it as a digital token on the Ethereum blockchain. This tokenized fund will enable investors to easily trade and transfer assets, bringing greater efficiency and transparency to the traditional fund management process. UBS believes that blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize the financial sector and is committed to exploring its various applications in order to stay at the forefront of innovation. Laut dem neuesten Whitepaper des UBS Sustainability and Impact Institute ist eine umfassende Sanierungsoffensive für Gebäude erforderlich, um die Netto-Null-Ziele des Pariser Klimaabkommens bis 2050 zu erreichen. Gebäude sind weltweit für 37% aller Treibhausgasemissionen verantwortlich. Das Whitepaper weist darauf hin, dass die Modernisierung von Gebäuden zur Energieeffizienzsteigerung und Reduzierung des Energieverbrauchs beitragen kann. Darüber hinaus werden Maßnahmen wie die Integration erneuerbarer Energien, die Verbesserung der Gebäudeisolierung und die Nutzung nachhaltiger Baumaterialien vorgeschlagen. Es wird betont, dass Regierungen, Unternehmen und Investoren zusammenarbeiten müssen, um die notwendige Finanzierung für diese Sanierungsmaßnahmen bereitzustellen. Die Umsetzung einer umfassenden Sanierungsoffensive für Gebäude kann dazu beitragen, den Klimawandel einzudämmen und die Nachhaltigkeitsziele zu erreichen. The article states that the public trading of a certain company is set to start on October 4, 2023. Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Deutsche Bank AG, and NatWest Markets N.V. have been appointed as the representatives for the public trading. It provides brief information without going into specific details about the company or the reasons behind its decision to go public. Adani, a company focused on solar manufacturing, has secured $394 million in funding from Barclays PLC and Deutsche Bank AG. The funds were raised through a trade finance facility to support Adani\\'s solar manufacturing efforts. This investment will likely contribute to the company\\'s expansion in the solar sector and help accelerate its growth. UBS Wealth Management has introduced a digital platform for structured products in Asia. The platform, named Direct Structured Investments, will offer clients in the region easy access to a range of structured products and services. This move comes as UBS aims to expand its offerings and improve its services in the fast-growing wealth management market in Asia. The platform will provide users with product information, education, and an online tool for simulating product returns. It also allows clients to customize their investment preferences and actively manage their portfolios.

According to Arthur Jurus from ODDO BHF, there has been an unjustified decrease in prices in the German residential real estate market.

Additionally, the article states that homeowners are hesitant to sell their properties at lower prices, leading to a shortage of available properties in the market. In conclusion, the article highlights the need for a better understanding of the factors affecting the German residential real estate market in order to make accurate predictions and avoid unjustified price decreases.

Greil erklärt, dass die deutsche Inflation seit einiger Zeit im negativen Bereich liegt und dies aufgrund der anhaltenden wirtschaftlichen Unsicherheit und der geringen Nachfrage nach Waren und Dienstleistungen zu erwarten war. Die niedrige Inflation stellt für die Verbraucher eine Entlastung dar, da die Preise für Güter und Dienstleistungen stabil bleiben oder sogar fallen. Dies kann den Konsum ankurbeln und das Wirtschaftswachstum unterstützen. Derzeit erhofft man sich, dass die wirtschaftliche Erholung nach der Covid-19-Pandemie zu einem höheren Inflationsniveau führen wird. According to economist Salomon Fiedler of Berenberg Bank, it is expected that inflation in Germany will continue to decline. Mark Matthews, Head of Research Asia at Julius Baer, explains why the company prefers US, Japanese, and Indian equities in a recent interview. Julius Baer believes that these markets offer better opportunities for investors due to their strong economic fundamentals and attractive valuations. Matthews notes that the US stock market has performed well and continues to exhibit resilience despite concerns about the ongoing pandemic and political uncertainty. Japanese equities, on the other hand, have historically demonstrated high quality, high dividend yield, and undervalued characteristics. India is seen as a long-term growth story with a favorable demographic outlook and potential for structural reforms. However, Matthews emphasizes the importance of diversification and not relying solely on these three markets, as other regions such as China also present compelling investment opportunities. Julius Baer aims to guide its clients towards a well-diversified portfolio to manage risk and potential volatility.

Commerzbank\\'s Chief Economist, Jörg Krämer, offers an assessment on whether Germany will have sufficient gas supply for the winter. Krämer explains that while Germany has experienced a decline in gas reserves due to reduced extraction from the Groningen gas field in the Netherlands, it is still well-prepared for the coming winter. The country has diversified its gas supply sources, especially from Russia, which is expected to continue providing sufficient gas during the winter months. Additionally, Germany has increased its liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports and has access to storage facilities. Krämer mentions that Russia has significant incentives to ensure gas deliveries to Europe, as its economy heavily relies on the energy sector. Despite occasional political tensions, he believes that gas supply disruptions are unlikely as both Russia and the EU share a mutual interest in maintaining stable energy flows. However, in the long term, Germany should aim to reduce its reliance on natural gas and further develop renewable energy sources. Overall, Krämer expects Germany to have a reliable gas supply for the upcoming winter. The Tuesday was another strong day for the USD. Ulrich Leuchtmann, Head of Foreign Exchange and Commodity Research at Commerzbank, discusses the factors that contributed to the currency\\'s strength.

Die FERI AG, ein führendes Beratungsunternehmen für Vermögensverwalter, prognostiziert, dass der höhere Marktzins die Gesamtrendite ausgewählter Hedgefondsstrategien steigern wird.

The report also revealed that BYD\\'s medium-sized sedan, the Seal, is 15% more cost-efficient than locally made Tesla Model 3 vehicles in China, and 35% more cost-efficient than Volkswagen\\'s European offerings. By producing Chinese-branded electric vehicles in China and exporting them to Europe, Chinese EV makers can maintain a 25% cost advantage over rivals.

To facilitate this, the company has established a special class of shares that offers exposure to cryptocurrencies.

The pilot project aims to gauge the demand for cryptocurrency investment products among institutional and retail investors, with the potential for a wider rollout in the future.

This advantage allows them to offer more competitive prices and undercut their rivals. According to a report by Credit SuisseUBS, India has defied the global trend of declining wealth in 2022.

These factors include ongoing supply chain disruptions, the high costs of energy and raw materials, and the slow transition towards renewable energy sources. Additionally, the German labor market is facing challenges, with rising wages and increasing labor shortages. Viebig emphasizes that these issues need to be addressed in order to prevent further economic decline in the country. According to Dr. Jan Viebig, an economist at Oddo BHF, Germany could become the \\\\\"sick man of Europe\\\\\" once again this year. The German economy is expected to grow at best by 3%, which is significantly lower than other European countries. Factors such as the slow pace of vaccinations, rising inflation, and supply chain disruptions have contributed to this decline. Additionally, the lack of investment in digital infrastructure and the transition to sustainable energy sources have hindered Germany\\'s ability to compete globally. Dr. Viebig warns that without prompt actions and reforms, Germany could face long-term economic stagnation. The article discusses the ODDO BHF Young Entrepreneurs Awards, which recognize and honor innovative startups that are leading the way towards the future. These awards aim to highlight the best among these young entrepreneurs who are making significant contributions to various industries.

In this article, Commerzbank\\'s Chief Economist, Jörg Krämer, provides an analysis of China\\'s financial situation. Krämer explains that despite concerns about China\\'s high debt levels and reliance on credit, the country is in a relatively stable position due to its large foreign exchange reserves. China holds the largest amount of reserves globally, providing a cushion against potential shocks. Additionally, while China\\'s debt has surged in recent years, it primarily consists of domestic debt, limiting the risk of a financial crisis like the one that occurred with external debt in the 1990s. Furthermore, the Chinese government has taken steps to address financial risks, implementing measures to control credit growth and deleverage certain sectors. Krämer suggests that although China does face challenges such as slowing growth and an aging population, its strong financial position gives it the flexibility to navigate these difficulties.

The report underscores the importance of monitoring such trends as they offer valuable insights for investors and businesses looking to navigate the evolving private equity landscape in France.

Therefore, while technology might be the key to unlocking the recruiting process\\'s full potential, companies should still humanize the process.

He added that the country needed strong social housing systems to ensure the affordability of property for lower-income earners.

The German DAX closed lower with the stock of laboratory equipment manufacturer Sartorius dropping by over 10%.

However, investors need to be selective, focusing on companies that can withstand potential volatility and market downturns. The small-cap segment presents an opportunity for investors looking to diversify their portfolios.

The report states that Allianz has the potential to climb from its current share price of \\\\u20ac183.74 up to a new target of \\\\u20ac259.08, indicating an increase of 23.20%. The analysis is based on the company\\'s positive financial results and its strong strategic position in the market. Allianz\\'s diversified business portfolio, coupled with its innovative product offerings and efficient cost management strategies, are expected to further enhance its growth potential and financial performance in the coming years.  The article further mentions that Allianz\\'s recent acquisition of Aviva has further strengthened its market position in the UK insurance market. According to Bloomberg\\'s weekly credit report, the warning issued last week by US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell during his testimony to Congress marked a \\\\\"wake-up call\\\\\" for investors, who may now be demanding higher yields or better protections against default from issuers. The report said this could lead to more corporate defaults, particularly among those companies with weaker credit ratings. It also highlighted the rise in global issuance of junk bonds and leveraged loans, which it said \\\\\"has fueled concerns about investors\\' reach for yield and a weakening of credit standards\\\\\". The Federal Reserve\\'s warning about rising financial risks in the US economy could lead to an uptick in corporate defaults, according to Bloomberg\\'s Credit Weekly report. The current environment of low interest rates and high leverage has made defaults relatively rare, even in the energy sector. However, if the Fed continues to raise interest rates, as it has indicated it will, defaults could increase, particularly in the lower-rated corporate bond market. As per the article, scientists at the University of California have developed an artificial intelligence tool that can spot and predict which individuals are at risk of becoming homeless. The tool uses data analytics and machine learning to sift through county records and identify factors such as employment and eviction history, social welfare involvement, and criminal records. The AI system can predict with 80% accuracy who will become homeless in the next two years. The researchers hope that this technology can be used by policymakers and social workers to intervene early and prevent homelessness. The article discusses the performance of the DAX 100 index in the past week, stating that it faced strong resistance at the 15,500-point level. The index later retreated to the 15,200-point level, and the article suggests that a fall below the 15,000-point level could lead to further downward momentum. However, if the index manages to break above the 15,500-point level, it could enjoy an upward trend towards the 16,000-point level. The article also highlights some of the individual stocks within the index that have performed well in the past week, such as Daimler and Siemens Energy. Investors have purchased a large number of call options for Vertiv, indicating confidence in the company\\'s future growth. The options allow investors to purchase the stock at a set price in the future, implying that they believe the stock will rise in value. Vertiv, a provider of critical digital infrastructure and continuity solutions, has recently announced several partnerships and acquisitions to expand its offerings in the data center and edge computing markets. This has likely contributed to the bullish sentiment among investors. B. Riley Wealth Advisors, an American financial services company, has lowered its holdings in Iron Mountain, a storage and information management company.

The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has submitted a proposed rule change to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that would allow companies to raise capital through direct listings of their shares on the exchange. This move would eliminate the need for a traditional initial public offering (IPO) and would allow companies to sell shares directly to the public. The proposed rule change would become effective on December 31, 2020, subject to approval by the SEC. The move is seen as a win for tech companies that have been pushing for the ability to raise capital through direct listings without having to go through the costly and time-consuming process of an IPO. The article reports on Tether\\'s announcement that it was once partially backed by Chinese securities, a fact that had not been previously disclosed.

The move is aimed at providing users with more options and greater transparency. The European Commission has proposed a \\\\u20ac750bn ($826bn) coronavirus recovery fund that would give out \\\\u20ac500bn in grants and \\\\u20ac250bn in loans. The Recovery Instrument aims to help EU economies badly hit by the pandemic and could boost investments in the Green Deal and digiti ation to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. European Council President Charles Michel will present the plan to member states for approval, which could take months. The plan needs the backing of all 27 EU members.

FRN Variable Rate Fix notes are a novel way for issuers to navigate the choppy waters caused by shifting interest rates, according to SWIFT\\'s Capital Markets Practice Lead, Chantal Van Es. The new debt instrument is designed to ensure the interest rate on the floating debt doesn\\'t fall too far in a low-interest environment. FRNs feature a two-tranche structure, with the lower tranche set to pay a premium, or coupon, to investors, equal to the difference between the variable rate and the fixed rate on the higher tranche. This means that if interest rates fall too far, investors in the lower tranche will still receive their coupons, as the excess spread between the two will be reallocated to them. The Fixed Rate Notes (FRNs) and Variable Rate Notes (VRNs) issued by some funds can lead to surprising changes in investor returns. While FRN funds offer a fixed interest rate, VRN rates can vary significantly depending on market conditions. As interest rates rise, investors may see increased returns on VRN funds, while falling rates can lead to lower returns, potentially resulting in unexpected losses. It is important for investors to understand the risks and potential rewards before investing in these types of funds.

The global semiconductor industry is facing a shortage as demand surges for chips used in electronic devices during the pandemic. The shortage has resulted in long wait times for companies that rely on semiconductors, such as automakers, and has led to production shutdowns and reduced output. The increasing demand for semiconductors is driven by the rise of remote work and online entertainment, as well as increased spending on home electronics. The supply of semiconductors is also being impacted by the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, as well as weather disruptions, which have impacted production in Texas. The shortage is expected to continue into 2022, with some analysts suggesting that the situation could worsen before it improves.

The report notes that both Binance and Coinbase have faced regulatory scrutiny and may face additional challenges as they continue to expand their businesses. Berenberg suggests that the regulatory pressure on cryptocurrency companies could increase in the coming years, leading to a need for more compliance measures and potentially limiting the growth of some of the industry\\'s key players.

Switzerland\\'s basic inflation has slowed to just under 2%, leaving the Swiss National Bank (SNB) with little reason to change its monetary policy.

Caldaro states that the recent formation of a \\\\\"cup and handle\\\\\" pattern indicates that the index has momentum behind it, and predicts a price target of around 5,100-5,200 for the S&P 500 in the coming months. However, he also warns that investors should be cautious of potential pullbacks and volatility, as the market is still in a state of flux due to the ongoing pandemic and economic factors.

The index has been consolidating in a range for the past few weeks but has managed to hold above key support levels.

Applied Materials, a company that provides equipment, services and software for the production of semiconductors and other electronic materials, has seen a recent increase in its stock price due to technical analysis indicating the possibility of an Inverse S-K pattern.

However, as always, there are no guarantees in the stock market and investors should carefully consider all factors before making any decisions.

Christian Olearius, former CEO and chair of MM Warburg, denies any wrongdoing in a tax evasion scandal.  <br>2. Prosecutors have appealed Olearius\\' previous acquittal, arguing he should be held accountable for facilitating the tax evasion scheme.  <br>3. MM Warburg, a German private bank, faces a lawsuit questioning the role of Olaf Scholz, former mayor of Hamburg and current German Chancellor, in illegal tax refunds.  <br>4. The lawsuit alleges substantial losses for the city of Hamburg, and Scholz\\'s involvement has become a focus in the trial.  <br>5. Olearius, as a partner in M.M. Warburg, is personally liable, according to court hearings relating to the cum-ex scandal.  <br>6.

It was published on June 28, 2023. The article also mentions the site navigation options available on Deutsche Bank AG\\'s website, including the ability to submit a press release. Der Ökonom Salomon Fiedler von der Berenberg Bank äußerte die Erwartung, dass die Inflation in Deutschland weiter zurückgehen wird. Er betonte, dass es sich um eine allgemeine Einschätzung handelt. Leider wurde keine weitere Information zu den Gründen für diese Annahme gegeben. The article discusses how major banks, including UBS, Deutsche Bank, and BNP Paribas, are facing increased scrutiny following the collapse of Credit Suisse. The collapse of Credit Suisse has drawn attention to the risk management practices of these banks and raised concerns about their stability. Regulators are now closely monitoring these banks to ensure they have adequate risk control measures in place. The article highlights the potential impact of these developments on the banking industry and the need for improved risk management practices to prevent similar crises in the future. The article discusses how three major banks, Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas, and Commerzbank, have increased their share in the niche debt market. This year has proven to be particularly favorable for these banks to capitalize on this market. Berenberg, a private German investment bank, is venturing into European carbon emissions trading. The bank, headquartered in Hamburg, aims to capitalize on the growing market for carbon credits and emission allowances. Berenberg plans to offer brokerage services to institutional clients interested in buying and selling carbon permits and offsetting their emissions. The move is a strategic shift for the bank, which has traditionally focused on more traditional areas of finance such as wealth management and investment banking. Berenberg\\'s entrance into the carbon trading market comes amid increasing attention on environmental issues and the need to reduce carbon emissions in Europe. The article is about Deutsche Bank AG London Branch and provides details about the financial advisers associated with the bank. The mentioned financial advisers are Daniel Ross, Derek Shakespeare, Oliver Ives, and Nicholas Hunt, who can be reached at +44 20 7545 8000. Deutsche Bank AG has recently issued 1 billion yuan worth of three-year bonds, representing its first entry into the Chinese market this year. The bonds were offered with a coupon rate of 3.21%. The article discusses the decline of the once prestigious private bank Merck Finck and its ongoing struggle. It highlights the arrival of new investors from Liechtenstein and provides a summary of all the news related to private banking from June to August. Johanna Handte, at the age of 46, will be leaving her position as Chief Investment Officer (CIO) at DWS and joining Bethmann Bank. She will take on the role of CIO at the beginning of the year. Handte has extensive experience in the financial industry, having worked in various senior positions at DWS for over two decades. Her expertise will be crucial in leading Bethmann Bank\\'s investment strategies and ensuring the success of their portfolio management. The article reports that Johanna Handte will be leaving her position at DWS to join Bethmann Bank. She will take on the role of Chief Investment Officer and Global Head of Asset Allocation at the bank. The article discusses the inquiry results of the safety status and security limit of Bank Julius Bär Deutschland AG. The article discusses Deutsche Bank AG\\'s plans to expand its operations in the United Kingdom following Brexit uncertainties. The bank aims to hire 100 additional staff members for its London office by the end of the year as it looks to provide a smooth transition for its European clients. This move is seen as a sign of confidence in London\\'s financial sector, despite concerns over potential barriers to trade with the European Union. The bank\\'s CEO expresses optimism about the bank\\'s prospects and reaffirms its commitment to serving clients in the UK market. Deutsche Bank, one of the largest financial institutions in the world, is poised to play a prominent role in an upcoming civil trial involving former US President Donald Trump. Several bankers from the bank are expected to testify in the trial, which will be held in New York. The trial revolves around allegations of fraud and deceptive practices stemming from loans made to Trump\\'s real estate business. The involvement of Deutsche Bank underscores its deep ties to the former president, as it has been a major lender to Trump for years. The testimony from the bank\\'s employees could provide crucial insights into the nature of the loans and the relationship between Trump and the bank. The UBS Europe has appointed two new members to its board of directors, Miriam Godoy Suarez and Filippo Bianco. The appointments will take effect from October 1, 2023. As a result, Tobias Vogel, the current chairman and Wealth Management Chief, will step down as head of the Investment Bank. The decision was made by the UBS Europe\\'s supervisory board. Godoy Suarez will assume the role of Chief Operating Officer(Head of Operations) within the company. UBS, the Swiss banking giant, is on the verge of finalizing a settlement regarding a claim made by Mozambique against Credit Suisse. This development marks progress in resolving one of the legal challenges that UBS inherited following its acquisition of Credit Suisse. The exact details of the settlement are not mentioned in the article. Next week, the trial between Mozambique and Credit Suisse will begin in London over the scandal involving the \\\\\"tuna bonds\\\\\". However, UBS is apparently pushing for a settlement in the case. The scandal revolves around the hidden debts amounting to $2 billion that Mozambique borrowed from international banks, including Credit Suisse and UBS, in 2013. The funds were meant to finance tuna fishing projects, but instead, a significant portion was diverted for personal profit, leading to a debt crisis in the country. While Credit Suisse is facing legal action, UBS seems eager to resolve the matter through a settlement instead of going to trial. This highlights the differing approaches taken by the two banks in handling the aftermath of the scandal. The article discusses the importance of the employees in the various regions of Switzerland who represent UBS. These employees play a crucial role in the successful integration of Credit Suisse. Berenberg Bank is restructuring its Wealth Management division, aiming to enhance its expertise and expand its capabilities. The move comes as part of the bank\\'s strategy to position itself as a leading European private bank. The newly formed team will be led by Matthias Jahn, who will be responsible for overseeing the division\\'s operations. This development is expected to strengthen Berenberg\\'s position in the wealth management industry and better serve its clients\\' needs. The distribution strategy of Commerzbank has raised discussions. Despite a successful restructuring and increased profits, analysts\\' expectations regarding dividend payout remain unfulfilled. The German government, as a major shareholder, is pressurizing the bank to pay back the state aid, while some investors argue that the bank should reinvest the profits to strengthen its capital position. The final decision regarding dividend payout will be made at the bank\\'s general meeting.

Commerzbank is continually focusing on enhancing its wealth management segment to meet the diverse needs of its customers. Die Herabstufung der Deutschen Bank durch die Ratingagentur Moody\\'s wird laut Ökonomen der Commerzbank, Bernd Weidensteiner und Christoph Balz, vorerst kaum Auswirkungen haben. Die Ratingagentur hat die Bonitätsnote der Deutschen Bank von A3 auf Baa1 herabgestuft und dies mit Bedenken über deren Fähigkeit zur Umsetzung ihres Strategiewechsels begründet. Die Commerzbank-Ökonomen sind der Ansicht, dass die kurzfristigen Auswirkungen begrenzt sein werden, da sich die Deutsche Bank auf die Stärkung ihrer Bilanz konzentriert und bereits Fortschritte in Bezug auf Kostenreduktionen und Risikoreduzierung gezeigt hat. Sie glauben jedoch, dass die Herabstufung auf lange Sicht zu höheren Refinanzierungskosten führen und das Vertrauen der Kunden beeinträchtigen könnte, wenn die Deutsche Bank nicht in der Lage ist, ihre Geschäftsstrategie erfolgreich umzusetzen.

level as part of its ongoing restructuring. Ermotti, who is due to step down from his role in November, has been leading the bank\\'s three-year restructuring plan which aims to cut costs and focus on wealth management. UBS has already announced plans to merge its two wealth management divisions into a single global unit and cut costs by $3.4 billion by the end of 2022. Julius Baer has opened a private banking office in Munich to target the business generated by the region\\'s high net worth individuals. The new branch will be headed up by Jurgen Worl, a 30-year financial services veteran with experience at Berenberg and Credit Suisse. It will focus on managing client portfolios and developing the customer base. The article discusses UBS Group AG\\'s plans to slash more than half of Credit Suisse Group AG\\'s employees in an effort to gain market share and seize top talent. This move comes after UBS overtook Credit Suisse in market value earlier this year. The plan is reported to involve reducing the workforce in areas where UBS is already strong, such as equities trading, while focusing on fixed-income trading and wealth management. The restructuring is expected to result in layoffs and voluntary departures, with UBS aiming to retain key staff from Credit Suisse. The firm also plans to capitalize on market disruptions caused by the Archegos Capital Management fiasco, hoping to secure prime brokerage clients. While UBS\\'s strategy may put pressure on Credit Suisse, analysts believe it is a necessary step for UBS to remain competitive and improve profitability. JP Morgan Chase has agreed to pay $290 million to settle lawsuits filed by Jeffrey Epstein\\'s victims after a judge gave preliminary approval to the settlement. The bank has been accused of ignoring signs that Epstein was involved in sex trafficking and moving money through the bank for illegal purposes. This is the largest settlement by a financial institution in an Epstein-related case to date. The settlement will be paid out over a period of years to accusers who are eligible to receive payments. The judge will give final approval to the settlement at a later date. HSBC Trinkaus & Burkhardt is advertising for a senior relationship manager for its Düsseldorf office. The successful candidate will be responsible for acquiring, developing and managing international client relationships, with a particular focus on family offices. They will also be tasked with coordinating business referrals with the bank\\'s internal divisions and providing guidance to less experienced colleagues. HSBC is looking for someone with a degree or equivalent qualification and fluency in English and German, with previous experience of working in a similar role. German private bank MM Warburg has launched a shipping credit fund that aims to raise at least \\\\u20ac150m ($181m). The Warburg-HIH (Hanover Investment Holdings) Shipping Credit Fund will invest in senior secured debt of shipping companies, including ship mortgages and financing of new vessels. The fund has a minimum subscription level of \\\\u20ac500,000 and a maturity of seven years. The Hanover-based fund seeks to tap into the growing demand for shipping financing that has arisen since banks pulled back on riskier forms of lending in the wake of the global financial crisis. Global  Wealth Management  Our approach  Regrouping at halftime. Explore UBS.com. Asset Management  Investment Bank  Wealth ... German investment website, Zertifikatecheck, has reported that there was a 74% surge in demand for Deutsche Bank options warrants in February, with more than 61,000 warrants sold. This comes shortly before earnings season began, and amidst concerns over Deutsche Bank\\'s solvency. The article discusses the hidden banking crisis in Germany. According to the article, many small and medium-sized banks in Germany are facing severe financial problems due to a combination of factors such as low-interest rates, high costs, and increasing competition from larger banks. Some of these banks are said to be on the verge of bankruptcy, which could have significant implications for the German economy. The article argues that the German government and regulators need to take action to address the issue and prevent a potential financial crisis. Wealth management assets at JPMorgan could take a hit if Credit Suisse\\\\u2019s advisors move to Wells Fargo, analysts predict. JPMorgan has been recruiting private bankers from Credit Suisse in Switzerland since reports emerged that the Swiss bank was considering selling its US wealth management operations. Since Wells Fargo is taking on Credit Suisse\\\\u2019s US private bank, many of the advisors that jump ship are likely to head north to San Francisco, which could translate into a decline in wealth management assets at JPMorgan. Analysts are predicting that JPMorgan will aim to retain current Credit Suisse clients, though there is no guarantee that existing client relationships will transfer to the departing advisors joining another bank. The European Union\\'s bank resolution authority is seeking additional firepower to deal with collapsed lenders on the brink of collapse during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Single Resolution Board (SRB) is seeking a deal on the uses of a so-called \\\\\"backstop fund,\\\\\" a pot of money that can help stabilize banks or help in winding them down in a crisis. The SRB also plans to increase its oversight of banks in Europe with the creation of a crisis management planning unit. The unit will seek to identify vulnerable banks and ensure that they have adequate recovery plans in place. JPMorgan has upgraded Commerzbank from underweight to neutral, following the bank\\'s recent announcement of cost cuts and job reductions. The move is said to be part of a broader trend of improved performance among European banks, with JP Morgan also upgrading Societe Generale and Credit Suisse to overweight. Commerzbank has struggled in recent years, with CEO Manfred Knof taking over in January 2021 and announcing a new strategy to focus on digitalisation and cost-cutting measures. Commerzbank\\'s stock price fell sharply amidst a weak financial sector, losing 4.2% in one day. The bank has been struggling with profit margins and restructuring to improve its performance. Other European banks, such as Deutsche Bank and HSBC, have also seen declines in their stock prices due to economic uncertainties. Deutsche Bank AG (DB) was down 1.71% in pre-market trading after disclosing that its second-quarter net profit will be negatively impacted by ongoing litigation, restructuring charges, and other costs. The bank said it now expects to post a net profit of approximately \\\\u20ac400m ($468m) for the quarter, missing analysts\\' expectations of \\\\u20ac509m ($596m). Despite the setback, the bank\\'s shares have gained 6.4% over the past month. Deutsche Bank has applied for a license to provide custody and trading services for digital assets in the European Union. Speculation is that this will increase the trading of the euro compared to the dollar and bring more institutional investors into the cryptocurrency market. Currently, most trading takes place in dollars, and European traders must convert euros into dollars to trade. If Deutsche Bank is granted the license, it will be one of the first banks to allow clients to buy and store digital assets alongside traditional types of investments. The Swiss National Bank (SNB) has encouraged policymakers to reconsider the safeguards in place for too-big-to-fail (TBTF) banks in the wake of COVID-19. The SNB advocated for the introduction of additional capital buffers and contingency plans for handling potential bank failures. In particular, the bank recommended an increase in the requirements of Swiss systemic banks, and the development of a resolution regime for such institutions. The comments came as a Swiss parliamentary committee decided to delay changes to the country\\'s banking law that would have allowed the SNB to impose negative interest rates on large deposits, rendering it unable to force banks to apply negative rates to deposits exceeding CHF50m ($53m). Deutsche Bank is reportedly planning to cut around 10% of its German retail workforce as part of its cost-cutting measures. The bank\\'s new CEO Christian Sewing has been trying to reduce costs since assuming the position in April. The cuts are expected to predominantly affect back-office and administrative roles. Deutsche Bank is yet to confirm the reports. The global transaction banking market is growing at a rapid pace, and is expected to experience huge growth in the coming years driven by the rising demand for digital payment solutions and the growth of cross-border transactions. The report highlights that Bank of America has become one of the leading players in transaction banking, with a strong focus on technological innovation, customer service, and risk management. Additionally, the report predicts that Asia-Pacific will be the fastest growing region for transaction banking due to the region\\'s strong economic growth, large population, and increasing focus on digital solutions. Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing has warned that the second half of 2023 is likely to be \\\\\"complex and challenging\\\\\" due to macroeconomic factors such as inflation and uncertainty around the pandemic. The bank is restructuring and investing billions in technology in an attempt to bolster its position amid strong competition in the financial sector. Sewing said the changes over the past three years have \\\\\"anchored a new culture\\\\\" at Deutsche Bank, while adding the lender\\'s investment in technology represented a \\\\\"paradigm shift\\\\\" from previous strategies. A subsidiary of French banking group Societe Generale has purchased a majority stake in the European amateur football federation F5WC. Boursorama Banque, a digital arm of Societe Generale, acquired its stake in F5WC from China\\'s Wanda Sports Group. The move is seen as a strategic one by Societe Generale to become more involved in the areas of sports and entertainment. F5WC is considered the largest amateur international football competition in the world, with more than 110,000 players competing across 50 countries. Deutsche Bank CEO, Christian Sewing, has said that he is open to more mergers and acquisitions (M&A) after the recent deal with Numis Corporation. The acquisition of Numis\\\\u2019 European division is part of Sewing\\\\u2019s plan to emphasize the bank\\\\u2019s institutional business, which generated 49% of the firm\\\\u2019s revenue in 2022. Analysts have suggested that the Numis deal may be a precursor to further acquisitions as the bank looks to expand its market share. However, Sewing has stated that the bank is not looking to engage in any large-scale mergers or acquisitions. Deutsche Bank has announced a public offer of up to \\\\u20ac1 billion ($1.2 billion) in Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital instruments. These instruments will have an interest rate that is resettable and will be subject to annual calls if certain regulatory requirements are met. The bank has also said that it will use the proceeds to fund business growth and strengthen its balance sheet. The offer is Europe\\'s first of its kind this year, and analysts say it is aimed at taking advantage of favourable market conditions, with investors searching for high-yielding securities amid the low-interest-rate environment created by central banks around the world. The article highlights the hidden banking crisis in Germany that has been brewing for years. The banking sector is plagued by a lack of profitability, low interest rates, high operating costs, and a plethora of regulations, causing many banks to merge or be acquired by larger institutions. The COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated these issues, with loan defaults and economic uncertainty increasing. The article argues that policymakers and regulators must take action to address this hidden crisis before it escalates and creates a systemic risk to the entire economy. Additionally, incentives should be put in place to encourage consolidation and mergers in the banking sector.

Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing has hinted there could be a \\\\\"strong recovery\\\\\" in trading in the second half of this year. Speaking at an event in New York, Sewing said the bank had a strong pipeline of transactions and was gaining market share in key areas. Deutsche Bank has been struggling to revive its trading business in recent years, with revenues dropping by 9% in the first quarter of 2023 compared with the same period last year. However, Sewing noted demand was stronger in some areas, including prime brokerage, and the bank was looking at new products and services. Deutsche Bank has announced plans to restructure its private customer business, with the aim of generating two-digit million euro savings. The changes include streamlining and digitising processes, as well as cost cutting. The bank\\'s Chief Operating Officer, Frank Kuhnke, has said there will be no job losses as a result of the move. UBS has won the title of Middle East\\'s Best Bank for Wealth Management 2023 at the Euromoney Awards for Excellence. The award was given based on UBS\\'s innovative approaches to wealth management, including its development of a digital platform for high-net-worth clients. UBS was also recognized for its commitment to transparency and ethical practices, as well as its strong local presence in the Middle East region. M.M. Warburg, a private bank in Germany, is currently seeking a Manager for IT Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC). The role involves managing and developing IT risk and compliance strategies, policies, and procedures. The candidate should have experience in risk and compliance management as well as excellent knowledge of relevant regulations and standards. The position is based in Hamburg, Germany. Deutsche Bank has filed an application with BaFin, Germany\\'s financial regulator, to become a licensed crypto custodian. The bank plans to offer services for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether, as well as digital assets such as security tokens. In recent years, Deutsche Bank has been exploring the potential of blockchain technology and has partnered with various companies to develop blockchain-based solutions for banking. The move into crypto custody marks the latest step in the bank\\'s digital transformation journey. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is exploring the development of cross-border integration platforms in order to facilitate the interoperability of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The managing director of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, stated that while CBDCs could offer significant benefits in terms of efficiency and financial inclusion, they also carry risks. Therefore, ensuring regulatory compliance and secure cross-border transactions is crucial. Georgieva added that the IMF is closely monitoring CBDC developments and will provide guidance to help safeguard the stability of the international monetary system. Shareholders of Numis have approved the company\\'s acquisition by Deutsche Bank. The deal, which was announced in March, will see Deutsche Bank purchase Numis for a cash consideration of £210m. Numis provides corporate broking, advisory and trading services, and has an extensive client base in the UK institutional market. The bank said the acquisition would accelerate its growth in the UK equity market and strengthen its client offering. For Numis, the deal offers access to Deutsche Bank\\'s global client network and broader distribution channels. Investment management firm First Republic has transferred its 401(k) plan clients from JPMorgan, choosing instead to partner with digital retirement platform providers Vestwell, ForUsAll, and Human Interest. The move follows the departure of Rick Suarez, a JPMorgan managing director who was key to First Republic\\\\u2019s relationship with the bank, earlier this year. The New York bank\\\\u2019s other wealth-management units continue to work with First Republic. UBS may see a $150 billion drop in wealth management client assets due to the pandemic-induced market volatility and economic slowdown, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. The decline could lead to a drop in revenue from fees and commissions, affecting the bank\\'s profitability. However, UBS has expressed confidence in its ability to weather the storm, citing its strong capital position and cost-cutting measures. The bank has also shifted its focus towards sustainable investing and digital platforms to attract and retain clients. The share price of Commerzbank decreased by more than 10% following the bank\\'s announcement that it would no longer achieve its previously stated profit goals for 2020. This is largely due to higher-than-expected restructuring costs and challenges faced by the bank in a low-interest-rate environment. Commerzbank is currently undergoing a major restructuring program, which includes cutting thousands of jobs and closing hundreds of branches in an attempt to improve profitability. Deutsche Bank shares have fallen due to concerns over the potential impact of a fine from a US regulator over its dealings with Danske Bank. The proposed $150m penalty from New York State\\'s Department of Financial Services follows Deutsche Bank\\'s role as correspondent bank to Danske Bank Estonia from 2007 to 2015. The fine is \\\\\"another reminder of the tough challenges banks are facing,\\\\\" according to a statement by Deutsche Bank, which also announced it would release its Q2 2020 figures early on July 16. Meanwhile, shares in\\xa0Commerzbank are said to be\\xa0\\\\\"still bearish\\\\\". Hauck & Aufhäuser Lampe has hired Christian Bluhm from Merck Finck as the new chief investment officer (CIO) for its newly merged wealth management division. Bluhm will lead the investment teams and oversee the management of assets for private clients, family offices and foundations. Hauck & Aufhäuser Lampe was formed through the merger of Hauck & Aufhäuser and Bankhaus Lampe earlier this year, with Bluhm\\'s appointment part of a broader restructuring effort. Deutsche Bank has applied for permission from BaFin, the German financial regulator, to provide digital asset custody services. The bank has joined a growing number of traditional financial institutions seeking to provide institutional clients with a crypto custody solution. Deutsche Bank already offers its clients a range of traditional custody services. The BaFin process typically takes between three and six months. UBS is set to begin hiring Credit Suisse bankers in Asia in July, following reports earlier this year that the Swiss Bank was planning on poaching Credit Suisse senior staff, following tensions between the two banks over client poaching and legal battles in the US. UBS is said to be planning to take on between 100 and 200 people in Asia-Pacific across its wealth management, investment banking, and asset management businesses. Meanwhile, Credit Suisse is reported to be planning to cut between 700 and 1,000 jobs globally, from senior roles across its investment bank. Deutsche Bank has appointed Fabrizio Campelli as its new head of retail wealth management. Campelli will oversee the revamp of the unit and work to increase its profitability to make it one of the bank\\'s key revenue drivers. He plans to introduce a new advice model and overhaul the bank\\'s digital capabilities to create a more personalized service for clients. Deutsche Bank aims to double its number of profitable clients in the retail wealth management unit by 2025. Deutsche Bank AG has reportedly sought approval from the German regulator BaFin to operate as a crypto custodian in Germany. This move has triggered a surge in the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin rising by more than 10% and other major cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Ripple also seeing significant gains. This move would allow Deutsche Bank to offer cryptocurrency services to institutional investors and could be a major step towards the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. UBS has called for an increase in the retirement age in Switzerland in order to help reform the country\\'s pension system. The bank suggested raising the age of receiving full retirement benefits from 65 to 67 by 2030 and stated that it is necessary to prevent the pension system from deteriorating further due to demographic changes. In addition to raising the retirement age, the bank proposed other measures such as reducing the conversion rate for pension savings and increasing the retirement savings contribution rate. Deutsche Bank has reportedly applied for a cryptocurrency custody license, according to a report from Germany-based business news outlet Handelsblatt. The application was made by Deutsche Bank\\'s newly created Digital Asset Custody unit, which was established earlier this year to explore opportunities in the digital asset space. If granted, the license would allow Deutsche Bank to hold and manage cryptocurrencies on behalf of its clients. Deutsche Bank has applied for a crypto custody license from the German financial regulator BaFin. The bank will be joining the growing list of financial institutions offering crypto-related services. In the meantime, the bank plans to set up a team of experts tasked with identifying digital asset-related risks and developing measures to address them. Deutsche Bank\\\\u2019s application comes at a time when Germany is working on regulating its crypto industry. So far, BaFin has approved just four firms for a license. LGT Wealth India has announced that it has appointed two former Credit Suisse executives, Jasmeet Singh and Anil Sarin, as its new CEO and COO respectively. Singh and Sarin bring extensive experience in the wealth management industry, having worked at various financial institutions such as Credit Suisse, Citibank and Merrill Lynch. LGT Wealth India aims to expand its presence in India\\'s wealth management sector and offer high-quality services to its clients. The article reports on the business activities of a Hamburg-based entrepreneur named Eckhard Fiene. According to data from Northdata, Fiene has founded and managed multiple companies over the years, including a construction company, an import/export business, and a real estate company. However, there is no information provided on the current status or success of these ventures. The article implies that Fiene has faced legal challenges in the past, including an imprisonment for tax evasion in 2010, but does not provide further details. Overall, the article provides limited information on Fiene\\'s professional and legal history. Deutsche Bank, the German multinational investment bank, is reportedly planning to launch a digital asset platform for institutional investors in Germany. The bank has announced that the new platform will provide custody and other services related to cryptocurrencies and will be integrated with its existing banking services for corporate and institutional clients. Deutsche Bank is reportedly in the process of developing a proof of concept for a potential offering, which will be subject to regulatory approval. If approved, the bank\\'s digital asset platform could be launched by the end of 2021. There are a few interesting innovations, launches, and collaborations mentioned in the articles. Berenberg Bank is expanding into asset liability management and increasing its lending capabilities to medium-sized companies with the support of the European Investment Bank. The bank is also expanding its wealth management capabilities and advisory services. Symrise, a fragrance and flavoring company, is launching a new product. Adriatic Metals has received positive coverage from Berenberg Bank. However, there is no direct information that could be relevant for wealth management competitors in these articles.<br><br>Sources:<br><p class=\"tile-text cursor-pointer card-text\"><span class=\"link cursor-pointer\"><img class=\"link-icon\" src=\"./static/media/icons-externalLink.44fdd7ea.svg\" height=\"24\" width=\"24\"><a alt=\"Symrise Buy von Joh.

UBS is facing a high penalty due to the Archegos fiasko, and it could face further fines over Credit Suisse\\'s dealing with Archegos. The bank is also facing lawsuits related to agenda issues and whistleblower complaints similar to Credit Suisse. Additionally, UBS\\'s risks related to customers, personnel, and deposits are being evaluated, and the combined UBS could make it difficult for Swiss private banks. UBS is also expanding its operations with key appointments in Europe, and its senior staff is mentioned in various articles. However, the most interesting development for UBS\\'s wealth management competitors is the exploration of digital Swiss Franc by Swiss banks.<br><br>Sources:<br><p class=\"tile-text cursor-pointer

Xinja will implement its finite licensing model in Australia and abroad, which will give access to the platform and intellectual property while maintaining strict control over the use of these assets. The company cited the regulatory burden and cost of running a retail bank as the reason for its decision to wind down this business. It will continue to operate in the funds management sector. Deutsche Bank has announced that it will partner with a cryptocurrency custody provider for institutional clients, as part of its plan to obtain a banking license for digital assets. The move will allow the bank\\'s clients to store and trade cryptocurrencies alongside fiat currencies in a highly-secure environment. Deutsche Bank\\'s clients will also benefit from the bank\\'s existing processes and technology for managing traditional assets. According to sources, the bank\\'s digital asset custody plans are still in the developmental stage and a launch date has not been set. Deutsche Bank has filed for a crypto custody license in New York, according to the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). This marks a formal move for the bank, which has previously hinted about entering the cryptocurrency space with the establishment of its digital asset custody platform in March. The license would allow Deutsche Bank to offer custody and trading services for bitcoin and other digital assets. It would also allow the bank to store and manage cryptocurrency on behalf of clients. Claudio De Sanctis has been appointed as the new head of the private customer division of Deutsche Bank from 1 July, according to a spokesperson for the German lender. The head of international wealth management at Credit Suisse, he will assume the role of CEO advising private customers at CEO level. De Sanctis will report to Karl von Rohr, President of Deutsche Bank, and will be a member of the Deutsche Bank Executive Committee. The financial advisor team at Nautilus Wealth Advisors has decided to split up and join other firms. The team members will move on to pursue different opportunities. The members of the team have expressed that they are all excited to move forward with their respective new ventures. Nautilus Wealth Advisors was founded in 2010 and is based in Stamford, Connecticut. The group specializes in providing customized financial advice and services to high net worth individuals, families, and businesses. The ongoing political and economic turmoil in Europe is forcing its wealthy to consider moving at least some of their assets offshore, with Switzerland being the most popular destination for the super-rich, according to UBS Group AG. For the first time, UBS has conducted an analysis of which European clients own assets outside their home country, and to which regions they have transferred their wealth. The bank found that about 15% of wealthy clients in Europe, the Middle East and Africa have relocated assets outside their home markets, with 5% moving at least a portion of their fortunes offshore. Swiss accounts have been the preferred choice for those seeking safety and tax benefits after home-country deposits. Nautilus Wealth Management, a team of financial advisors in California, has joined UBS. The team, which manages over $1.2 billion in client assets, will operate as part of UBS Private Wealth Management in La Jolla. The move reflects UBS\\'s ongoing efforts to expand its footprint in California and its commitment to providing access to world-class investment expertise to high-net-worth clients. The NatWest Group (NWG.L) recently received a positive rating from Berenberg, a German bank, after it stated that the bank had built a strong capital position and improved its profit margins. Berenberg also commended NatWest\\\\u2019s strategy to develop digital banking capabilities and reduce expenses, while maintaining its leadership position in commercial banking in the UK. Despite these positive factors, Berenberg warned that the bank\\\\u2019s success could be hampered by the ongoing Brexit negotiations and the uncertain economic outlook for the UK. The article discusses the positive impact of restructuring efforts on Germany\\'s largest banks. Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, two of the country\\'s largest lenders, have made significant progress in improving their financial performance and stability after undergoing extensive restructuring measures. These measures included cost-cutting initiatives, reducing risky assets, and focusing on core businesses. As a result, both banks have seen an increase in profits and capital ratios, leading to improved investor confidence. However, the article also highlights the challenges that lie ahead, such as the need to address legacy issues and adapt to the changing banking landscape. Overall, Germany\\'s largest lenders are reaping the benefits of their restructuring efforts, but continued vigilance and adaptation will be crucial for long-term success. The number of private banks in Switzerland is steadily declining, according to a report by the Swiss Private Bankers Association. In 2020, there were 84 private banks in the country, down from 108 in 2010. The report cites various factors for the decline, including increased regulation and competition from digital banks and asset managers. However, the report also notes that the remaining private banks are performing well, with a combined net profit of CHF 3.2 billion ($3.5 billion) in 2020. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the European Central Bank, Andrea Enria, has spoken about the impact of COVID-19 on the European banking industry. Enria noted that, while the banks had entered the crisis in a strong position with robust capital and liquidity buffers, the pandemic is still expected to have a significant impact on the industry and could lead to loan losses of up to \\\\u20ac1.4 trillion over the next three years. He added that the ECB\\'s supervisory arm will continue to monitor the situation closely, and banks must remain vigilant to ensure they have sufficient capital and liquidity to weather the storm. Deutsche Bank has applied for a license to offer custody services for digital assets, according to reports. The bank has submitted an application to Germany\\'s financial regulator, BaFin, and will await approval before offering services such as managing digital assets like Bitcoin for third-parties, or providing a marketplace for cryptocurrencies. Deutsche Bank is one of several traditional financial institutions exploring ways to get involved in the fast-growing cryptocurrency market. German private bank Berenberg has secured a \\\\u20ac100m ($121m) loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB) to expand its lending to medium-sized businesses. The EIB\\'s support will allow Berenberg to grant more long-term loans and working capital to eligible German firms with annual revenues of up to \\\\u20ac500m. The EIB\\'s loan to Berenberg falls under its support for the investment plan for Europe, commonly known as the Juncker Plan. Comdirect Bank AG, Commerzbank AG\\'s online banking subsidiary, has partnered with Google to develop voice authentication for its mobile banking app. The new feature, which uses voiceprints to verify a user\\'s identity, will be introduced during the third quarter of 2016. Comdirect is the first German bank to use voice authentication for mobile banking. Deutsche Bank is reportedly seeking to enter the cryptocurrency market by applying for a digital asset custody license. The bank has submitted an application for a custody license for its trust subsidiary in the state of New York. The license would allow Deutsche Bank to store and safekeep digital assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum on behalf of clients. The move comes as other banks such as BNY Mellon and JPMorgan have already announced plans to enter the cryptocurrency market. Deutsche Bank has applied for a digital asset license as part of its growth push. The license would allow the German bank to offer services for cryptocurrency-related assets, including custody and trading. Deutsche Bank has been exploring various opportunities in the digital asset space, including developing a digital asset platform and partnering with fintech firms. The move comes as traditional banks are increasingly looking to expand their offerings in the digital asset space in response to growing demand from institutional and retail clients. Deutsche Bank has applied for a license from Germany\\\\u2019s financial regulator, BaFin, to offer crypto custodial services, according to reports. The move would allow the bank to store digital assets on behalf of clients, a service that has been gaining popularity among investors looking to diversify holdings into cryptocurrencies. Deutsche Bank has not yet confirmed whether it intends to enter the crypto market, but the move follows other major banks, including HSBC and Standard Chartered, that have recently been exploring crypto custody services. Private banks in the UK are preparing to implement the incoming consumer duty, which will be overseen by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The new rules, which come into effect in December, will require banks and other financial institutions to act in the best interests of customers, and may require significant changes to systems and processes. Industry experts have warned that the deadline is tight, and that private banks that are particularly reliant on bespoke services may want to bring in consultants for assistance. Deutsche Bank has applied for a license to custody digital assets, adding to the bank\\'s push to expand its digital offerings. The move comes after the bank announced earlier this year that it was developing a fully integrated digital asset custody platform, which will allow institutional clients to securely store, transfer and manage cryptocurrency and other digital assets. This license application also follows other major banks such as JPMorgan Chase and BNY Mellon moving into the digital asset space as institutional demand grows. Deutsche Bank\\\\u2019s application is currently under review by the German financial regulator BaFin. Julius Baer, the Swiss private banking group, has been named the \\\\\"Best in the World for High-Activity Clients\\\\\" at the PWM Global Private Banking Awards. The bank topped the category for the third consecutive year, with judges praising its ability to adapt to changing needs and demands of high-activity clients, as well as its innovative use of technology to offer professional portfolio management services. The awards were presented by PWM, a specialist publication for private bankers and wealth managers. In an interview with German finance publication Asset Standard, Prof. Dr. Jan Viebig, Chief Economist at ODDO BHF, argues that the European Central Bank (ECB) has more reason to raise interest rates than the US Federal Reserve (Fed) at present. He points out that inflation in the Eurozone has reached 2% and the ECB\\\\u2019s bond purchasing programme has stabilised the economy; whereas the US economy is much stronger and the Fed has not yet reached its inflation target. Viebig also notes that the ECB might suppress pressure to raise interest rates from Germany. This article is a speech delivered by Andrea Enria, Chair of the Supervisory Board of the European Central Bank, at the European Banking Federation\\'s Online Conference. Enria discusses the impact of COVID-19 on the banking sector and the role of the ECB in supporting the economy. He touches on the importance of maintaining adequate capital and liquidity buffers, as well as the need for banks to adapt their business models to the changing environment. Enria highlights the ECB\\'s supervisory priorities, such as the need for banks to fully implement the new prudential framework, and emphasizes the importance of promoting sustainability in the financial sector. Finally, Enria discusses the challenges and opportunities posed by digitalization in banking, and the role of regulators in ensuring a level playing field for all market participants. UBS, the Swiss multinational investment bank, is partnering with Credit Suisse in India to create a more capital-efficient model for its operations in the country. Known as a \\\\\"capital-light\\\\\" model, the approach will aim to minimize the amount of capital UBS has to hold on its books while still being able to offer a full range of investment banking services to its clients in India. The move comes as UBS and other banks look for ways to improve their profitability amid a tough market environment and changing regulatory requirements. The partnership with Credit Suisse is expected to help UBS reduce its costs by sharing resources, while also increasing its ability to win new business. UBS, the Swiss multinational investment bank, could face heavy fines over its involvement in Credit Suisse\\'s dealings with Archegos Capital Management. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) are investigating UBS\\'s margin lending practices to Archegos, which are believed to have contributed to the downfall of the family office last month. UBS is yet to comment on the investigations, but Credit Suisse has already faced significant financial and reputational damage in the wake of the scandal. The merger of Credit Suisse and UBS Private Banking is not expected to happen soon, according to experts. While a merger would create the world\\'s largest private bank, issues such as the potential cultural conflict between the two institutions, the potential job losses, and regulatory hurdles may delay the process. However, rumors of a merger are expected to continue due to the increasing pressure faced by both banks to improve profitability and shareholder returns. Julius Baer has won Euromoney\\'s \\'World\\'s Best Private Bank\\' award for Western Europe, as the pandemic has led to a surge in demand for wealth management services. The bank has seen a sharp rise in demand among ultra-high networth clients and has aimed to develop its services through the Covid-19 pandemic. Julius Baer\\'s CEO, Philipp Rickenbacher, said that the award is important to the bank as it shows how it has been able to meet clients\\' needs while navigating the pandemic. Warburg Bank has appointed Mirko Prinz as head of its Frankfurt office, where he will oversee the private banking and asset management business. Prinz previously worked as head of capital markets sales at DZ Bank and had stints at Deutsche Bank, Merrill Lynch and Citigroup. The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) has filed a prospectus with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosing its plan to issue a new batch of bonds under its medium-term note programme. The bank expects to raise up to $4bn in the sale of debt securities over the coming months, and says it plans to use the net proceeds to fund general corporate purposes. The prospectus provides additional details on how the bonds will be sold and managed. Deutsche Bank has named Credit Suisse\\'s Joachim Althof as its new global head of foreign exchange electronic trading sales. Althof is expected to start in his new role in September, and will be based in London. He will report to Deutsche Bank\\'s global co-heads of FX Alexander Leitch and Kevin Rodgers. The appointment comes as Deutsche Bank continues to make senior hires in its fixed income currencies and commodities division. Deutsche Bank has hired Alison Yeung from Credit Suisse for its Asian Pacific Equity Capital Markets (ECM) co-head position. Yeung will work alongside David Lynne, who is the other co-head. Yeung was previously with Credit Suisse for over two years and has also worked with JPMorgan and UBS. The hiring follows Deutsche Bank\\'s expansion plan for its Asian Pacific operations. Deutsche Bank has agreed to pay $75 million to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by victims of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The bank is accused of having facilitated Epstein\\\\u2019s sex trafficking operation by allowing him to make large, frequent transactions with no apparent legitimate business purpose. The settlement follows a US regulator\\\\u2019s $41 million fine against Deutsche Bank in 2020 for violating anti-money laundering rules in relation to Epstein\\\\u2019s transactions. The article reports that Julius Baer, a Swiss private bank, has been struggling to stay afloat in recent months due to a number of scandals and issues. These include allegations of money laundering, tax evasion, and compliance failures. The article suggests that the bank\\'s management has not taken these issues seriously enough and has failed to provide sufficient guidance and leadership. As a result, the bank\\'s stock price has taken a hit and investors are losing faith. The article concludes by stating that unless Julius Baer takes decisive action to address these issues, it will continue to suffer and struggle in the months ahead. Investors in Julius Baer Gruppe and VTX Bär have experienced significant returns in recent months due to the strong performance of the two Swiss banks\\' shares. Julius Baer Gruppe, which specializes in wealth management, has seen its shares rise by 34% over the past six months, while VTX Bär, a regional bank, has seen its shares increase by almost 80% over the same period. Both banks have attributed the gains to strong financial performance and a positive outlook for the financial sector in Switzerland. The wirehouse recovered the entirety of an outstanding loan from advisor Robert D. Cohen and defeated counterclaims alleging defamation and improper termination. The Swiss private bank Julius Baer has recorded a strong first half of 2021, according to its quarterly report. The bank\\'s assets under management increased to CHF487bn ($530bn) as of the end of June, up 21% year-on-year. The bank also reported a 28% increase in adjusted net profit to CHF602m, compared to the same period in 2020, and a return on CET1 capital of 14.3%. The strong performance was driven by net inflows of CHF10.5bn and market performance. The bank also noted that it had made progress in implementing its sustainability strategy, with the launch of a new sustainability-focused portfolio and a new advisory offering for clients looking to incorporate sustainability into their investments. There are several articles regarding Berenberg Bank, including their expansion into asset-liability management, as well as their analysis and opinions on various companies such as Porsche, Aroundtown SA, Compugroup Medical, Marqeta Inc, Adriatic Metals PLC, and Verallia. They have also expanded their advising business and acquired new companies themselves. The articles do not mention any specific innovations, launches, or collaborations on financial products or services.<br><br>Sources:<br><p class=\"tile-text cursor-pointer card-text\"><span class=\"link cursor-pointer\"><img class=\"link-icon\" src=\"./static/media/icons-externalLink.44fdd7ea.svg\" height=\"24\" width=\"24\"><a alt=\"Porsche Automobil vz Buy (Joh.

Berenberg Bank is expanding its consultancy business in Germany with the appointment of a new executive board member. Markus Peters will join the firm next year as part of a bid to increase the bank\\'s client reach. Peters, who has 20 years of experience in the finance sector, was previously the head of wealth management at Frankfurt-based private bank Bethmann Bank. German bank Berenberg is set to expand its offering in the asset liability management (ALM) space, with plans to hire experts and develop new products for institutional clients. The move is part of a broader strategy to diversify the firm\\'s services. ALM involves balancing a company\\'s assets with its liabilities in order to manage risk, and is particularly relevant for insurance companies and pension funds.

The new hires include Duncan Mann, who was previously co-head of UK M&A at Citigroup, and William Nicholls, who was part of BofA\\'s coverage team for UK-based multinational companies. The hires come as Deutsche Bank seeks to turn around its fortunes following a series of scandals and losses. Deutsche Bank\\'s August 18th options began trading today.

The article highlights that the departing midfielder, Jude Bellingham, had expressed his appreciation for the club and stated that it had been the biggest part of his life. European banks have seen an uptick in deposit outflows as the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the economy and lowers interest rates, according to data from the European Central Bank. In June, 14 out of 34 large banks observed deposit outflows, marking a reversal from May. Smaller banks had fewer issues with outflows, and some have even experienced inflows as customers seek alternative financial options in the current economic climate. Additionally, the ECB\\'s executive board member, Isabel Schnabel, has called for caution in banks\\' distribution of dividends, citing concerns over financial stability. Swiss bank Julius Baer has agreed to pay $79.7m to resolve allegations that it engaged in a money laundering scheme involving more than $36m in bribes. The Department of Justice said the bank admitted that it conspired to launder assets associated with the bribery scheme from 2009 to 2018, including through accounts in Switzerland, Russia, Singapore, and the UK. Several of the bank\\'s employees were also charged in the conspiracy. Julius Baer said it had cooperated fully with the investigation and had taken measures to enhance its compliance and controls. Swiss private bank Julius Baer is closing its Cayman Islands subsidiary, which was established in 2009, as part of a broader move to simplify its organisational structure. The decision was made after a review of the bank\\'s operations and the regulatory environment. Customers of Julius Baer in the Cayman Islands will be transferred to the bank\\'s Swiss headquarters and will be offered the same services. The closure is expected to be completed by the end of 2022. Swiss bank Julius Baer has partnered with crypto service provider Taurus to launch digital asset trading and custody services. The move follows client demand for access to the asset class. Julius Baer will offer access to a range of services, including secure storage and transaction solutions. An official statement stated that it would \\\\\"continue to monitor the developments in digital assets closely.\\\\\" In an interview with the European Central Bank\\\\u2019s (ECB) banking supervision chair Andrea Enria, he said that Europe\\\\u2019s banks have weathered the challenges of the past year flexibly and robustly. Enria also talked about the challenges that banks will face in the future, including the threat of climate change, digitalisation, and the rise of crypto assets. He stressed that banks need to understand the risks emanating from the evolving financial landscape and design their business models to remain relevant and sustainable in the long run. Enria also added that ECB aims to ensure that banks are devoting resources to improve their risk management and their systems for monitoring climate-related risks, in accordance with the requirements of the European Union (EU) climate regulations. UBS, a Swiss multinational investment bank and financial services company, has completed its takeover of Credit Suisse\\'s wealth management business after receiving approval from regulatory bodies. The takeover solidifies UBS\\'s position as the world\\'s largest wealth management behemoth, with $3.2 trillion in assets under management. The transition of Credit Suisse\\'s operations is set to be completed by June 2023. The acquisition will give UBS access to new markets and clients, as well as bolster its presence in the United States. Goldman Sachs has announced it will post impairments on its commercial real estate loans in the third quarter due to the pandemic\\'s impact on its lending portfolio. This comes after the institution strengthened its balance sheet in the previous quarter, raising $2.5bn of debt at lower rates as investors sought the bank\\\\u2019s high-quality ratings. While Goldman Sachs noted that loan-loss provisions for the commercial banking sector had peaked, industry analysts have suggested there may be a delay between expected losses and the classification of charge-offs as banks hold off on seizing collateral. Deutsche Bank has announced a temporary suspension of open-ended exchange-traded commodity (ETC) securities. The decision comes after the bank failed to calculate the value of the ETCs due to a recent reshuffle of the management teams in charge of the assets. Deutsche Bank has instructed investors to sell or redeem the securities before 18 December because it wants \\\\\"to ensure that investors are not adversely affected and that the ETCs can be liquidated in an orderly manner\\\\u201d. Law firm Linklaters has advised an international bank consortium on a \\\\u20ac5bn ($5.8bn) revolving syndicated loan for BMW. The deal was led by UniCredit Bank and Bayerische Landesbank, and involves 11 banks from Europe, Asia and the US.

BMW has committed to reducing the carbon emissions of its fleet by at least 30% by 2025. Wolfgang Link, the programming chief of German television network ProSiebenSat.1, has resigned from his position. Link has worked for the network for over 20 years and has served in various roles, including managing director of ProSieben and CEO of Red Arrow Studios. The step comes after ProSiebenSat.1 CEO Rainer Beaujean announced a new restructuring program, which includes cost-cutting measures and refocusing the company\\'s business strategy on its core areas. DWS Group, the asset management arm of Deutsche Bank, has announced several promotions of female executives as part of its effort to increase gender diversity within the company. The promotions come as several male executives have left the firm. DWS has set a target of having women in 35% of all leadership positions by 2025. Currently, women make up 28% of all management positions at the firm. DWS is one of several financial firms working to address the issue of gender diversity in the industry. Former Julius Baer Bank employees have won an appeal over a British ban related to alleged misconduct over Venezuelan bonds. The UK\\\\u2019s Upper Tribunal, in a ruling published on Thursday, said the regulator had mischaracterised the employees\\\\u2019 alleged misconduct and that the decision to ban them from the industry should be overturned. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) had also said in 2019 that it had fined Julius Baer International £2.9m over inadequate money laundering controls and its approach to risk management relating to clients who were politically exposed. The head of institutional sales at JP Morgan Asset Management Deutschland, Andreas Koerner, is leaving the company, Citywire reports.

It is not yet clear who will succeed Koerner in the role. Frankfurter Bankgesellschaft has appointed Carola von Schmettow, formerly the chief risk officer at ABN Amro, to its executive board. Von Schmettow will take charge of compliance, risk management and human resources. Turkey has appointed its first ever female central bank governor, Naci Agbal. Agbal has served as a finance minister in the past and replaces former governor Murat Uysal, who was fired last week. Her appointment comes amid market tensions and a plummeting lira currency. It is hoped Agbal\\'s experience in economic management will help stabilise Turkey\\'s economy and financial markets. Berenberg Bank is expected to experience a drop in net profit in 2022 due to various factors such as the global economic slowdown, low interest rates and increased regulations affecting the wealth management industry. The bank\\'s CEO, Hendrik Riehmer, has acknowledged the challenges facing the industry but remains optimistic about the bank\\'s long-term prospects. Berenberg Bank\\'s assets under management rose by 13% in 2019 to \\\\u20ac46bn and the bank has continued to expand its business in Europe and the US.

The automotive technology company Dürr plans to acquire BBS Automation for up to \\\\u20ac480 million ($566 million). BBS Automation is a global supplier of automated systems for the automotive industry, offering solutions for assembly lines, testing equipment, and material handling.

The deal is subject to regulatory approval and expected to close in the first quarter of 2022. UBS has cut several members of the leadership team of Credit Suisse following the latter\\'s merger with UBS, announced in August. In particular, Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam and CFO David Mathers have been let go. UBS is taking on a significant amount of Credit Suisse\\'s assets, including about $180bn in client assets, and will help Credit Suisse sell off a range of assets. The merger, which is expected to close early next year, will create one of the world\\'s largest banks. Swiss bank Credit Suisse has officially been acquired by rival UBS, marking the end of an era for the company that was once one of the world\\'s largest financial institutions. The acquisition was first announced in 2019, but regulatory hurdles and legal issues delayed its completion. The newly combined entity will be one of the largest banks in Europe and will have a significant presence in financial centers around the world.

Staley is now the CEO of Barclays, but previously served as chairman of JPMorgan\\\\u2019s private bank, which maintained a relationship with Epstein prior to his arrest in 2019. The questioning will be part of a lawsuit brought by two Florida women who claim that Epstein sexually assaulted them. The women\\\\u2019s lawyers argue that Staley may have information relevant to the case and should be required to testify. Barclays has said that it has full confidence in Staley and that he has fully cooperated with authorities. UBS Bank AG has entered into a loss protection agreement with Swiss groups Helvetia Insurance and Swiss Life. Under the terms of the agreement, UBS will be able to recover 90% of its losses on distressed credit products in excess of a certain amount, with Helvetia and Swiss Life assuming the remaining 10%. The move is part of UBS\\\\u2019 ongoing efforts to improve risk management and reduce potential losses.\\xa0 Deutsche Bank AG has announced plans for a public offer, aiming to increase its Common Equity Tier 1 capital. The shares are expected to be priced between \\\\u20ac9.50 and \\\\u20ac10.00 each, with a minimum subscription of 10 shares. The offer period is set to begin on August 26 and end on September 8. The bank is aiming to raise up to \\\\u20ac1.9 billion through the offer. According to a new report from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Turkish and Swiss banks were among the least cost-efficient in Europe during Q1 2021. The report found that Turkish banks had an average cost-to-income ratio of over 66%, while Swiss banks had an average of 65.6%. In contrast, Nordic banks were found to be the most cost-efficient, with a regional average cost-to-income ratio of 44.2%. Overall, European banks saw their cost-to-income ratios improve in Q1 due to cost-cutting measures implemented during the pandemic. However, S&P anticipates that the ratio may increase again in the coming quarters as banks begin to reinvest in growth initiatives. The German bank M.M. Warburg is reportedly exploring a potential merger with Deutsche Bank, which could potentially create the largest private bank in Germany with assets of around \\\\u20ac400bn. The two banks have not yet confirmed the report. In other news, Dutch semiconductor company Nexperia has reportedly been acquired by Chinese firms Beijing Jianguang Asset Management and Wingtech Technology in a deal worth $3.6bn. Meanwhile, Credit Suisse has reportedly commenced legal action against a number of former employees and third parties in connection with its dealings with Greensill Capital. In the US, Uber plans to invest $150m in a joint venture with South Korean automaker Kia to develop electric vehicles. Finally, UK publisher Telegraph Media Group has reportedly been sold to a consortium including Punter Southall Group founder Jonathan Punter and former investment banker Patrick Barwise. Credit Suisse has reportedly put up its China brokerage venture, Credit Suisse Founder Securities, for sale as it prepares for changing regulations in the country. The move is expected to fetch the Swiss bank around $300m. The China Securities Regulatory Commission has set a deadline of 2020 for international companies to own no more than 49% of joint ventures with Chinese securities firms, which Credit Suisse hopes to comply with by selling its stake in the venture. German private bank M.M. Warburg has revealed a \\\\u20ac147m ($175m) loss for 2019, a significant deterioration on the previous year\\'s \\\\u20ac31m loss and the worst in the company\\'s history. The bank blamed the performance on write-offs relating to investments in two troubled German property companies, Apo-Asset Management and Dolphin Trust. The bank has also been hit with fines relating to tax evasion investigations. The losses are likely to put pressure on Warburg\\'s owners to sell the bank, with private equity firms touted as potential buyers. The bank\\'s CEO, Joachim Olearius, has suggested that a merger with another bank could be an alternative option. UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti has warned that the coming months may be \\\\\"bumpy\\\\\" as the bank integrates its business with parts of Credit Suisse. The two Swiss banks are scheduled to finalise the deal, which focuses on UBS\\'s wealth management business, in early June. Ermotti told a virtual conference that the process was \\\\\"slightly more complex than we thought\\\\\", partly due to regulatory delays. He also cautioned that the finalisation of the agreement could be postponed due to Covid-19 containment measures. Two senior investment bankers at Credit Suisse have left to join rival firms, dealing yet another blow to the Swiss bank\\'s struggling investment banking unit. Christopher Williams, managing director and co-head of leveraged loan capital markets, has joined Jefferies Financial Group. Meanwhile, Mark Simonian, a managing director in Credit Suisse\\'s technology banking group, has left to join Moelis & Company. The departures highlight the ongoing challenges faced by Credit Suisse\\'s investment banking unit, which has seen multiple high-profile exits in recent months.

The author criticizes the bank for not having made more progress in turning the situation around, especially in light of the improving economic environment.

Christian Olearius, CEO of Warburg Bank, is looking for additional owners to join the bank\\'s partnership in order to strengthen its capital base. Olearius believes this could help the bank expand its business and offer more services to its clients. Warburg Bank recently reported strong financial results, which has boosted its reputation in the market and could attract interest from potential investors. However, Olearius has stated that any new partners must share the bank\\'s values and commitment to client service. The Head of Deutsche Bank\\'s private bank in Asia, Lok Yim, has left the bank less than a year after taking on the role. Yim\\'s departure comes amid a shake-up at the bank as it seeks to turn around a decline in profits. Deutsche Bank has been struggling with losses, falling revenue and failed stress tests in recent years, leading to several rounds of cost cuts and restructuring. The bank\\'s new CEO, Christian Sewing, has promised to simplify the bank\\'s business and focus on its core strengths. Warburg Bank, one of Germany\\'s oldest private banks, plans to drastically reduce its private banking operations and cut jobs as part of a large-scale transformation plan. The bank\\'s CEO, Christian Beckmann, said the decision was made due to the challenges facing the industry, such as low interest rates, rising costs and increasing regulation.

The job offers a competitive salary package and the opportunity to work with a dynamic and innovative team. The Wall Street Journal argues in an opinion piece that current bank regulations do not work as they are intended to. The article suggests the recent failures of banks like Wells Fargo and Deutsche Bank demonstrate that regulation has not done enough to prevent risky behaviour. The piece criticises the constant rewriting of regulation as being confusing and disjointed, with insufficient focus on compliance. It argues that a change of approach is required, including a combination of better capital requirements and improved incentivisation to promote adherence to the rules. Citigroup has introduced a new policy which will require clients in industries including firearms retailing and manufacturing, tobacco, and coal mining to restrict sales to people aged 21 and older and to pass background checks for employees selling the items. The policy also applies to clients that manufacture, sell or distribute bump stocks, high-capacity magazines and other similar accessories. Citigroup becomes the first major bank to introduce gun control measures following the mass shooting in Florida last month. The global retail banking market is expected to reach $2,840.70 billion by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate of 6.8% between 2021 and 2030, according to a report by Grand View Research. This growth is attributed to factors such as the rising demand for digital banking services, increasing use of mobile payments, and the growing number of initiatives by banks to enhance their customer experience. However, the report also notes some challenges to the industry, including regulatory compliance issues and the threat of cyberattacks. Additionally, the Asia-Pacific region is expected to see the highest growth rate in the market over the forecast period. Goldman Sachs has maintained a neutral rating on Deutsche Bank\\'s asset management unit, DWS, with a target price of \\\\u20ac31 ($36) per share. Despite the firm\\'s strong performance in terms of net inflows and cost controls, Goldman is concerned about the impact of European fund fee regulation and potential competition from large US asset managers. However, DWS is seen as a key part of Deutsche Bank\\'s turnaround strategy and could benefit from increasing interest in ESG investments. Investment banking and asset management group Investec has acquired a majority stake in boutique mergers and acquisitions advisory firm Capitalmind. The Netherlands-based firm will work closely with Investec\\'s established European operations, expanding its capabilities in the mergers and acquisitions sector. Capitalmind has advised on transactions worth approximately \\\\u20ac4bn since its inception in 2001. Financial terms of the deal were not revealed.

The lawsuit was filed against JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp, Credit Suisse Securities USA LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc, and UBS Securities LLC by investors who claim that the banks conspired to fix prices and unduly influence the market for CDS, which are contracts that allow investors to bet on the risk of default on corporate debt.

Schmettow, who is nicknamed as Schleef in the corporate world, will take charge of HSBC Deutschland\\'s board of directors. She will replace Werner Steinmueller, who will become a special advisor to HSBC group CEO Noel Quinn. Schleef was previously the head of hsbc Trinkaus & Burkhardt AG. The Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) has become the first central bank to issue digital currency. The currency, which will be initially circulated among the organisation\\'s member states, will operate alongside physical cash. Digital cash vouchers equivalent to US dollars will be issued to commercial banks and credit unions in the region, which will then distribute the digital money to consumers. The ECCB said the move would boost the digital economy and streamline transaction processing. Frank Vogel, a former stockbroker and alleged mastermind behind the \\\\\"cum-ex\\\\\" scandal, has been arrested in the Netherlands. The cum-ex scheme involved buying and swiftly selling shares around the day a company paid out dividends, allowing investors to claim multiple tax rebates. German authorities say Vogel was a key member of a network that carried out such trades, allowing them to illegally recoup \\\\u20ac145m between 2007 and 2011. He is expected to be extradited to Germany, where he may face charges of tax evasion and money laundering. After the acquisition Credit Suisse and American Depositary Shares will be removed from SIX and NYSE. According to a study by the private banking think-tank Capco Institute, private banks are taking digitalisation seriously with the majority having already begun adopting new technologies or adapting existing ones. The report revealed that although private banks are facing challenges, including changing client demands and demographic shifts, digitalisation is seen as a way to address these challenges. Private banks are investing heavily in artificial intelligence and data analytics to improve customer experience, with over 76% of banks surveyed having already implemented some form of AI. The firm lured four advisor teams from its wirehouse rivals including New Yorkbased The BG Group which boasts Forbes bestinstate advisors Michael Bromberg and Daniel Gerschel. Swiss private bank Julius Baer is targeting $250m for a fund focused on private equity investments, primarily in Europe and the US. The fund, which is aimed at institutional and high-net-worth clients, is part of the bank\\'s strategy to expand its alternative investments offering. Julius Baer has been focusing on increasing revenue from its wealth management business as it looks to offset the negative impact on profit margins from increasing regulatory costs. Julius Baer, a Swiss private banking group, is targeting $250m for a fund that will focus on private equity. The fund will be open to hedge funds, family offices and other institutional investors, according to anonymous sources. Private equity has become a popular way for private banks to generate more revenue and attract new clients. Julius Baer has not commented on the reports. Swiss private bank Julius Baer has raised CHF 250m ($266m) in equity capital, primarily to help finance its acquisition of Deutsche Bank\\'s Luxembourg wealth management unit. The move comes after the bank said earlier this month that it had agreed to purchase the Deutsche unit for an undisclosed fee, in a push to expand its presence in Europe. The acquisition is expected to be completed by the end of this year. Three investment bankers have resigned from Credit Suisse\\'s US division, including an equity capital markets-focused director, a vice president who covered the healthcare sector, and an energy-focused coverage banker. This comes amid ongoing turmoil at the Swiss bank, seeing multiple high-level departures, a $4.7 billion loss due to the collapse of Archegos Capital Management, and an espionage scandal. Credit Suisse CEO Thomas Gottstein wrote in an internal note that the bank aims to introduce additional measures to ensure business conduct aligns with its values. Credit Suisse has lost three investment bankers in the US as the bank continues to deal with the aftermath of the Archegos and Greensill scandals. The departures come after Credit Suisse\\'s global head of mergers and acquisitions, Greg Weinberger, resigned earlier this month. Credit Suisse has been grappling with a $4.7 billion hit from Archegos and the fallout of backing Greensill Capital. The bank has also lost significant business in the prime-brokerage segment following the twin debacles. Deutsche Bank\\'s trust unit has settled a lawsuit alleging that it failed to properly monitor a $725 million loan to SunEdison. The lawsuit, filed in 2017 by the US Department of Labor, argued that Deutsche Bank Trust Co Americas had breached its fiduciary duties by failing to monitor the loan, which provided financing for SunEdison\\'s acquisition of wind energy firm First Wind. SunEdison filed for bankruptcy in 2016. The settlement amount has not been disclosed. HSBC Trinkaus Burkhardt, a German subsidiary of HSBC, is seeking a Deputy Head of NAV Control for its custody business. The role involves managing a team responsible for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of net asset value calculations for fund clients. The successful candidate will have a degree in finance or accounting and at least five years\\' experience in a related role. Strong communication skills and the ability to work under pressure are also required. The position is based in Düsseldorf. A unit of Deutsche Bank AG agreed to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to settle a lawsuit stemming from a $725 million loan made to SunEdison Inc. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart M. Bernstein in New York last month approved an agreement between DB Energy Trading LLC and SunEdison\\\\u2019s bankruptcy estate to pay $320 million to resolve allegations that Deutsche Bank improperly accelerated the loan and enriched itself to the detriment of other creditors. The settlement came just weeks after SunEdison\\\\u2019s estate pursued an objection against Deutsche Bank but agreed to resolve all of its allegations against the bank. The bank said that it was pleased to have reached the settlement as it allowed it to \\\\u201cdispose of significant legacy issues\\\\u201d.

HSBC Germany has announced a major restructuring, which will see it focus on corporate banking and wealth management and exit its retail banking business. The move will involve cutting around 1,000 jobs and reducing the bank\\'s branches from 244 to around 180. The restructuring will also see\\xa0the appointment of a new CEO,\\xa0Detlef Frye, who will take over from\\xa0Johannes Ganser at the end of June.

HSBC Deutschland, the German subsidiary of the global bank HSBC, is undergoing a restructuring and has appointed a new CEO, Tobias Reichmuth. The restructuring will see the bank focus on its corporate and institutional banking business, while reducing its retail banking operations. Reichmuth, who was previously head of HSBC\\'s operations in Switzerland, will lead the bank\\'s efforts to strengthen its position in the German market and improve its profitability. HSBC Deutschland has faced challenges in recent years, including declining revenue and low profitability. Deutsche Bank will deliver dividend shares to its employees as part of the bank\\'s employee share ownership plan. The delivery of these shares will take place on June 1st, 2021 and is part of the overall strategy to strengthen the bank\\'s culture and employee engagement. The delivery will be based on the number of Deutsche Bank shares held by an employee on the ex-dividend date, April 1st, 2021. UBS Group AG announced on Monday that it has completed the acquisition of Credit Suisse Group AG\\\\u2019s private banking business in Germany. The acquisition will help UBS in its bid to boost its private banking business. The companies had agreed to the takeover in September 2019, but the process was held up by regulatory approval. The deal was first announced as part of a restructuring plan at Credit Suisse, which has been seeking to improve profitability by focusing more on wealthy clients. UBS Group AG is acquiring a majority stake in ConsenSys-backed digital assets firm, Cognito, according to a company statement. Cognito provides tools that allow financial institutions to securely transfer assets and data. The acquisition is slated to help Swiss bank UBS extend its insight into digital asset benefits. The article discusses a recent email sent by Julius Baer Monaco to its clients, warning them of the risks associated with investments in cryptocurrencies. The email stated that the bank does not offer any cryptocurrency-related products and that any such investment is not covered by the bank\\'s client depositor protection scheme. The email also highlighted the lack of regulation and the potential for fraud in the cryptocurrency market. The article suggests that the email may be an indication that more traditional banks are becoming more concerned about their clients\\' potential exposure to the risks of cryptocurrency investment.

Hütter justified his decision by stating that the playing style of Dortmund required different tactics, and that he had to make difficult choices regarding his lineup. Germany\\'s financial sector needs more critical voices to counterbalance the power of its dominant banks, according to Gerhard Schick, a former MP and founder of advocacy group Finanzwende. Schick said the country\\'s financial system is still heavily influenced by the big banks, which have resisted structural reform. He called for more action to tackle problems such as high levels of household debt and the financial risks of climate change.

Some animal rights activists are calling for a boycott of the Bank due to its investments in companies involved in animal testing.

The article suggests that the debate highlights the difficulty in reconciling ethical beliefs with practical actions, and the importance of being informed when making choices about where to invest and donate money.

German bank Berenberg has maintained its \\\\\"buy\\\\\" rating for Symrise, a producer of flavours and fragrances, with a price target of \\\\u20ac124 ($147) per share. The bank noted Symrise\\'s resilience amid the Covid-19 crisis, with the firm reporting \\\\\"strong\\\\\" third-quarter results driven by the food and pet food segments. Berenberg also said Symrise\\'s proposed acquisition of Sensient\\'s fragrances business would significantly boost its market share in the fragrances segment. However, the bank warned that there was still uncertainty regarding the pandemic\\'s impact on the cosmetics and personal care sectors, which account for nearly half of Symrise\\'s sales. German chemical company Symrise\\'s rating of \\\\\"buy\\\\\" has been reaffirmed by the Berenberg bank. Symrise has seen significant growth recently, with revenue increasing by 22.5% in the last quarter. The company has also reported strong demand for its fragrances, with perfume sales up by 16%.

Investment bank ODDO BHF has downgraded biotech company Sartorius from \\\\\"buy\\\\\" to \\\\\"neutral\\\\\" and lowered its target price to \\\\u20ac325 ($394) per share in a flash analysis. This came after Sartorius stock increased by 58% during the past year, a trend that analysts believe will soon slow down. The COVID-19 pandemic has boosted demand for Sartorius\\' laboratory equipment as companies rushed to produce vaccines, drugs, and diagnostic tests. ODDO BHF has downgraded its rating on Sartorius to \\\\\"neutral\\\\\" from \\\\\"buy\\\\\", with a target price of \\\\u20ac325 per share. The downgrade comes after the share price has risen by more than 30% since the start of the year and has exceeded the target price set in the previous \\\\\"buy\\\\\" rating. ODDO BHF believes that the growth prospects for Sartorius are largely priced in and that the company may face headwinds from an anticipated slowdown in growth in 2023. Financial services firm ODDO BHF has downgraded life science and biotech firm Sartorius to \\'neutral\\' and lowered its target price from \\\\u20ac360 to \\\\u20ac325. The analysts pointed to supply chain issues, increasing competition and regulation as factors impacting the company\\'s outlook. Despite this, Sartorius has outperformed the German MDAX Index by 20% since the beginning of the year. Investment bank Oddo BHF has downgraded Sartorius to \\\\\"neutral\\\\\" with a target price of \\\\u20ac325 ($393). The bank cited the German biotech company\\'s strong stock performance and prospects for slower growth in 2021 as its reasons for the downgrade. Sartorius develops and produces technologies for the biopharmaceutical industry, and has experienced significant market gains due to the Covid-19 pandemic, with its Q4 2020 results reporting a sales increase of 43.8%. The investment bank ODDO BHF has downgraded its recommendation for Sartorius from \\\\\"buy\\\\\" to \\\\\"neutral\\\\\" and reduced its price target from \\\\u20ac400 to \\\\u20ac325. This is due to the high current valuation of the company, which ODDO BHF believes may be too high in relation to its growth prospects. Sartorius has been performing well, with strong growth in its bioprocessing and lab product segments, but ODDO BHF is concerned about the potential for reduced demand in the lab product segment due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Investment bank Oddo BHF has downgraded Sartorius AG to neutral with a target price of \\\\u20ac325 ($369), citing concerns about the scientific equipment and services provider meeting its financial objectives. Sartorius recently reported strong sales and earnings growth in the first quarter of 2021 and raised its guidance for the year. However, Oddo BHF said it remains concerned that the company\\\\u2019s margin targets may be difficult to achieve due to the pace of investment, particularly in its bioprocess solutions unit. Investment firm Oddo BHF has downgraded biotech company Sartorius from \\\\\"buy\\\\\" to \\\\\"neutral,\\\\\" and cut its target price to \\\\u20ac325 ($389) from \\\\u20ac370 ($443). Analysts cited the \\\\\"very high\\\\\" valuation for the stock, as well as limited near-term organic growth prospects. Despite the downgrade, Sartorius remains one of Oddo\\'s preferred picks in the life sciences sector. French renewable energy company Neoen has received a maintained recommendation from banking group Oddo BHF. The group has assigned a \\\\\"buy\\\\\" rating to the company, citing its positioning within the global renewable energy sector as a key factor. Neoen has a diversified portfolio of renewable energy assets, including wind, solar and energy storage, and a strong presence in France, Australia, and Central America. The company reported a 2020 revenue of \\\\u20ac324m ($381m) and expects to see further growth in the coming years. According to an analysis by investment bank Jefferies, MTU Aero Engines, a German aircraft engine manufacturer, has been rated as \\\\\"hold\\\\\" with a target price of \\\\u20ac170. Although the demand for aircraft engines is currently low due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Jefferies remains optimistic about the long-term prospects of the aviation industry and believes MTU will benefit from new engine models and services in the future. However, they also noted that competition in the industry is becoming more intense and that a slow recovery from the pandemic could continue to impact MTU\\'s financial performance. German fragrance and flavoring company Symrise has been given a rating of \\\\\"buy\\\\\" by Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (Berenberg Bank). The bank has set a target price of \\\\u20ac120 ($141) on the stock, which it believes represents a potential upside of around 13% from Symrise\\'s current price. Berenberg cited Symrise\\'s strong position in the fragrance and flavoring market, as well as potential growth opportunities in sectors such as pet food and plant-based products, as reasons for its positive outlook on the company. Sartorius stock has dropped after the company issued a negative guidance for the full year. The life science company now expects its operating profit margin to fall to 19% compared to its previous forecast of 23%. Sartorius cited weaker business development in its bioprocess solutions division due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company\\'s shares fell by around 9% following the announcement.

Investment bank Berenberg has maintained its \\\\u201chold\\\\u201d rating on Sartorius with a target price for the lab equipment and life science provider of \\\\u20ac448 ($539). Berenberg said Sartorius is \\\\u201cuniquely positioned\\\\u201d to benefit from growth in the biopharma market, but said the company\\\\u2019s shares were fully valued. Berenberg increased its earnings forecasts for both 2021 and 2022, reflecting increased investments and potential for further margin improvement. German investment bank Berenberg has upgraded Sartorius Vorzuege shares from Sell to Hold, with a price target of \\\\u20ac298. Berenberg commented that Sartorius stock, which has risen by around 60% over the last six months, was being driven by advances in biopharmaceutical drug development and the need to understand and combat pandemic pathogens.

The rating is based on the broker\\'s strong growth prospects and potential for further expansion into new markets.

ODDO BHF, a French-German investment company, has upgraded its rating of online broker flatexDEGIRO to \\\\\"outperform\\\\\" and set a target price of \\\\u20ac13 per share. The rating is an improvement from the previous \\\\\"neutral\\\\\" rating, and the target price is almost double the current market value of flatexDEGIRO\\'s shares. The upgraded rating was based on the online broker\\'s first-quarter financial performance, which exceeded analysts\\' expectations, and the company\\'s successful integration with DEGIRO. The upgrade also takes into account the continued growth of the online broker market, which is expected to benefit flatexDEGIRO. Oddo BHF, a French investment bank, has raised its rating on online brokerage firm FlatexDEGIRO to \\\\\"outstanding\\\\\" with a target price of \\\\u20ac13 ($15.5) per share. The bank cited the company\\'s strong cost control and growth potential as reasons for the upgrade.

ODDO BHF has confirmed its \\\\\"buy\\\\\" rating on the shares of Saint-Gobain, the French multinational corporation specialising in the production of construction materials and high-performance materials, despite the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the company\\'s business. The analyst highlighted the positive impact of the recovery of the construction sector, as well as Saint-Gobain\\'s strong position in markets such as flat glass and insulation materials. French multinational corporation Saint-Gobain has had its recommendation rating confirmed by financial services provider Oddo BHF. The firm restated its \\\\\"buy\\\\\" rating for Saint-Gobain shares, predicting growth driven by infrastructure projects globally and higher demand for building materials. Despite setbacks like the pandemic and an \\\\\"unfavourable mix effect\\\\\" in the last quarter of 2020, Saint-Gobain has maintained a high cash flow and strong e-commerce presence. The financial services company ODDO BHF has raised its rating for FlatexDEGIRO to outperform and set a price target of \\\\u20ac13 ($15.40) per share. The German online broker has experienced rapid growth in recent years and recently acquired DEGIRO, a Dutch online brokerage firm. The company\\'s management has indicated a continued focus on expansion and technology investment. ODDO BHF believes that FlatexDEGIRO\\'s competitive pricing and international growth potential make it an attractive investment opportunity. Investment bank ODDO BHF has raised its rating on FlatexDegiro, a German online brokerage, to \\\\\"outperform\\\\\" and has set a price target of \\\\u20ac13 ($15.50) per share. The bank cited the company\\'s strong growth potential, expanded product offering, and acquisition of DEGIRO as positive factors. However, it warned that regulatory risks, fierce competition, and potential consolidation within the industry could pose challenges for FlatexDegiro. Investment bank Oddo BHF has raised its rating on German online broker Flatexdegiro to \\\\\"Outperform\\\\\" and set a price target of \\\\u20ac13 ($15.40) per share. This is up from its previous rating of \\\\\"Neutral\\\\\" and a target price of \\\\u20ac8.40 ($9.90) per share. Oddo BHF said that Flatexdegiro\\'s strong performance in the first half of 2020, with a 136% increase in net revenues year-on-year, was behind the upgrade. The bank also said that the acquisition of DEGIRO, which is expected to close in Q4 2020, would be a \\\\\"significant value creation\\\\\" opportunity for Flatexdegiro. Berenberg has maintained its \\\\\"hold\\\\\" rating for Sartorius and has set a price target of \\\\u20ac448 ($532). The biotech company reported stronger-than-expected earnings for the second quarter of 2020, with revenues up 17% year-on-year to \\\\u20ac613m. However, Berenberg believes that uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and the impact of potential lockdowns on Sartorius\\' supply chain could affect its growth outlook, leading them to maintain their rating. Shares in Sartorius initially saw gains in June despite a profit warning, but these gains later dissipated as the month wore on. However, some analysts remain optimistic about the German laboratory equipment maker\\'s long-term prospects. Investment bank Berenberg analyst has retained its \\\\\"hold\\\\\" rating on Sartorius, a German laboratory and pharmaceutical equipment maker, with a price target of \\\\u20ac448 ($526), despite the company experiencing rapid growth driven, in part, by the coronavirus pandemic. Berenberg noted that Sartorius\\' shares have appreciated by approximately 300% in the past three years on the back of successful acquisitions and partnerships as well as on the demand for biotech products. However, Berenberg expressed concerns that demand is being driven solely by the pandemic and that it could decelerate once the pandemic subsides. Berenberg has maintained its \\\\\"Hold\\\\\" rating on Sartorius shares, with a target price of EUR 448. The decision has been influenced by the company\\'s positive third-quarter results, with revenues rising 14.4% year-on-year due to strong demand related to the pandemic. The biotech company also raised its full-year guidance for 2020 as a result. However, Berenberg remains cautious about Sartorius\\' valuation, which it considers high, and believes that current levels do not offer a buying opportunity for investors. GlaxoSmithKline plc (LON:GSK) has received a consensus rating of \\\\\"Hold\\\\\" from the twenty research firms that are covering the company.

Despite the downgrade, UBS maintained its \\\\u201cbuy\\\\u201d rating on Sartorius, noting that the company\\\\u2019s underlying growth remained strong. French-Italian semiconductor firm STMicroelectronics is trading at an undervalued rate, according to financial services group Oddo BHF. This comes despite the firm delivering strong results in its third quarter earnings call, with net revenue hitting $2.67bn and revenue growth reaching 18.9%. However, Odds BHF has predicted worse performance for STMicroelectronics\\' strong areas \\\\u2013imagery and electronics\\\\u2013 over the next few years due to competition from rival firms. Despite the prospect of a temporary decrease, the firm has \\\\\"multiple external growth targets to strengthen its businesses\\\\\", according to Oddo BHF.

Investment bank Berenberg has lowered its price target on Heidelberger Druckmaschinen, a German printing company, from \\\\u20ac2.60 ($3.06) to \\\\u20ac2.40. The bank maintained its buy rating on the stock, but highlighted that its target reflects lower risk-adjusted returns than previously forecast. It cited a global slowdown in growth and the resulting pressures on the printing industry as contributing factors to the new target. Berenberg added that more diversified printing businesses, such as packaging and label printing, may offer more attractive options for investors. Berenberg has lowered the price target for Heidelberger Druckmaschinen from \\\\u20ac3.20 to \\\\u20ac2.40, while maintaining its Buy recommendation.

The bank notes Marqeta\\\\u2019s strong position in the digital payments space, specifically with e-commerce and gig economy clients. However, Berenberg also raises concerns about competition and pricing pressures in the market.

The bank maintains its rating of \\\\\"buy\\\\\" for Mersen\\'s stock, with a target price of \\\\u20ac33 per share. This comes after Mersen announced its 2020 full-year results, which showed an overall decline in sales due to the Covid-19 pandemic but also highlighted growth in certain areas such as renewable energies and specialty graphite. The confirmation of ODDO BHF\\'s rating is seen as a positive sign for Mersen\\'s prospects in the future.

The financial institution set a \\\\u20ac38 ($45) price target for Mersen\\'s shares.

The German property company is performing well, with an increasing number of new development projects and attractive acquisitions adding to its portfolio. Aroundtown is also trading at an attractive discount to net asset value, making the shares an attractive investment opportunity. French healthcare company Bastide has received positive commentary from investment research firm Invest Securities, following the release of its yearly results, which showed a 16.8% rise in its consolidated revenues.

Berenberg has downgraded Compugroup\\\\u2019s rating to \\\\\"hold\\\\\" from \\\\\"buy\\\\\" and cut its price target to \\\\u20ac86 from \\\\u20ac92, citing limited upside potential. Berenberg expects the healthcare software maker\\\\u2019s margins to be under pressure, as it sees investment needs in data privacy, and competition remains high.

In a note, Berenberg analyst Tom Jones said that CompuGroup faces significant competition in the healthcare IT market, with larger competitors taking market share, while the market itself is experiencing lower growth.

However, it is important to note that Deutsche Bank\\'s reduction in holdings does not necessarily signal a lack of confidence in BioNTech\\'s future prospects, as the bank may simply be rebalancing its portfolio.

Berenberg expects the aviation industry to begin a recovery in the second half of 2021, driven by increasing vaccination rates and easing travel restrictions.

The IT solutions provider can benefit\\xa0from the growing demand for digitisation and cloud services. SNP can also gain from the wider adoption of cloud and on-premise solutions and the potential growth from adjacent solutions like SAP S/4 HANA and SAP SuccessFactors. However, the company\\'s accelerated pace of M&A can make it difficult to predict its financial performance. Investment bank Berenberg has raised its target price for German software company SNP Schneider-Neureither & Partner to \\\\u20ac33.50 per share, while maintaining its \\\\\"hold\\\\\" rating.

Berenberg has raised its price target on RWE to \\\\u20ac57 and maintained a \\'buy\\' rating. The German energy company has seen a surge in earnings from its commodity trading business due to increased market volatility in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. RWE\\'s earnings in the first quarter soared by more than a third as a result. Additionally, the company has been able to accelerate its shift towards renewable energy sources, further strengthening its position in the market. Berenberg expects RWE to announce further strategic initiatives\\xa0to bolster\\xa0its renewables portfolio in the coming months. German investment bank Berenberg has increased its target price for RWE from \\\\u20ac44 to \\\\u20ac57. The bank maintained its buy recommendation for the company. The energy company has been performing well, with its first-quarter earnings exceeding market expectations and its full-year guidance left unchanged. Berenberg also noted the company\\'s successful merger with E.ON\\'s renewable assets and increasing dividend payouts. The bank believes that RWE is well-positioned to capitalise on the growing renewable energy market and benefit from its low carbon footprint. Berenberg Bank has reiterated its buy recommendation for Croda International after the chemical company reported a strong set of Q2 numbers. Gross profit for Q2 jumped 17.7% YoY to £146.5m ($192m), while revenues increased by 3.5% to £413.3m. Berenberg Bank says that while Croda\\'s valuation \\\\\"looks full\\\\\", it is justified by the company\\'s \\\\\"fundamentally different category exposure, stable growth and strong new product pipeline\\\\\". Croda develops, produces and sells speciality chemicals, which are used in a range of industries, including food, health and beauty. Berenberg Bank has reiterated its \\\\\"buy\\\\\" rating for Croda International, a British specialty chemicals company. The bank predicts that Croda\\'s earnings per share will increase 12% this year and 11% in 2024, driven by the company\\'s focus on sustainable products and a strong pipeline of innovative products. Additionally, the bank sees the potential for Croda to make acquisitions that could accelerate its revenue growth. Hauck & Aufhäuser IB has maintained its \\\\\"Buy\\\\\" rating for Jost Werke with a target price of \\\\u20ac80 ($94), following the company\\'s Q3 results. Despite a decline in revenues and EBITDA, the investment bank sees improvement in the commercial vehicle market and is optimistic regarding Jost\\'s long-term prospects. The company\\'s stock price has risen by about 25% year-to-date. PNC Financial Services Group has reduced its stake in the British multinational oil and gas company, BG Group. PNC sold 630,440 shares for approximately $28.72 million, reducing its stake in the company by 2%. PNC had previously held 3.5% of BG Group\\'s shares. The move is part of PNC\\'s strategy to simplify and focus its business model. French asset management firm, ODDO BHF, is recruiting 53 employees in Tunisia for its Tunis-based IT services and development center. The new hires will join a team of 180 IT professionals already based in the center, which services ODDO BHF\\'s asset management, private banking and corporate finance clients. The Tunisian center forms part of the group\\'s strategy to build its nearshore and offshore IT capabilities. The stock price of Hannover Re, a German reinsurance company, has risen by over 5% due to news of improved profit expectations for the current financial year. The company previously forecasted a profit of 1.15 billion euros but has since raised this to 1.2 billion euros due to lower-than-expected claims in its property and casualty business. This news has helped boost investor confidence in the company, leading to the increase in share price. Swatch Group\\'s shares were given a sales rating by ODDO BHF. The bank set a target price of CHF 250 ($273.52) for the company\\'s stock. ODDO BHF reaffirmed its sales rating for Swatch Group. ODDO BHF, a French financial services company, has given a \\\\u201cneutral\\\\u201d rating to luxury goods conglomerate Richemont due to concerns about lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and currency fluctuations. Despite Richemont\\\\u2019s recent strong financial results, ODDO BHF analysts believe that the luxury goods industry is not out of the woods yet. They also worry about the continued strength of the Swiss franc, which could be detrimental to Richemont\\\\u2019s bottom line. Oddo BHF, a financial services company, has lowered its price target on CIE Financière Richemont, a Swiss luxury goods company, from CHF 122 to CHF 117 but has maintained its neutral recommendation. The decision comes after CIE Financière Richemont\\'s Q1 sales update revealed strong growth in Asia and the Americas, however, the company\\'s key markets in Europe and the Middle East remain under pressure due to Covid-19 restrictions. Despite the positive sales growth in some regions, Oddo BHF believes that current economic uncertainties and risks outweigh the company\\'s short-term sales performance. Financial services firm Oddo BHF has lowered its price target on Swatch Group but has maintained its \\\\\"underperform\\\\\" recommendation on the Swiss watchmaker\\'s stock. The bank cited concerns about Swatch Group\\'s declining gross profit margins,\\xa0weak demand for watches,\\xa0and increasing competition from smartwatches. The bank\\'s new price target for Swatch Group is CHF 220 ($241), down from CHF 247 ($270).  Investment firm ODDO BHF has maintained its position on French drinks company Remy Cointreau, praising the company\\\\u2019s efforts to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. The firm added that Remy Cointreau should be able to maintain its strong margins on a long-term basis. Deutsche Bank Research has maintained its \\\\\"buy\\\\\" rating for Verbio, a German biofuels producer, and set a price target of \\\\u20ac50 ($56). Despite the company missing its earnings guidance for the first half of the year, analysts believe the long-term outlook is still positive as Verbio is set to benefit from higher demand for biofuels, especially in Europe, in the coming years as governments introduce stricter carbon reduction targets. Jefferies has downgraded its price target for Delivery Hero from \\\\u20ac113 to \\\\u20ac87, stating that the firm\\'s investment in Glovo has increased risk. The news comes after Delivery Hero raised its full-year profit target from \\\\u20ac1.6bn to \\\\u20ac1.8bn as the pandemic fueled online food orders. The article discusses the recent downgrade of the Belgian supermarket chain Colruyt Group by ODDO BHF, a Franco-German financial services firm. ODDO BHF cited concerns about the company\\'s profitability, citing increased competition and margin pressures in the Belgian retail market. The author notes that Colruyt has historically been viewed as a strong performer in the retail industry, but recent challenges have led to a drop in the company\\'s share price and a negative outlook. Despite this, the author remains optimistic about Colruyt\\'s long-term prospects, citing its strong balance sheet and market position. Zum Inhalt.

Henkel, a German consumer goods company, has announced price increases on its products for the second time this year due to rising raw material and packaging costs. The price hikes will be implemented in two phases: the first will take effect in September and the second in December. The company stated that the increases are necessary to maintain its quality standards and ensure a sustainable supply chain. Despite the price increases, Henkel reported strong second-quarter results with a 7.7% increase in sales compared to the same period last year. Online retailer Showroomprivé has increased resources for its liquidity contract with financial services company Oddo BHF.
